# DevOps Odyssey 🚀

A hands-on journey through the core concepts of software delivery, from Docker basics to full-scale CI/CD automation with Jenkins. This repository contains 8 meaningful labs, evolving step-by-step to simulate real-world DevOps scenarios.

## 📚 Labs Overview

| Lab | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **SDLC & Docker Basics** | Understanding the software lifecycle and containerizing a simple Python app. |
| **02** | **Git & CI/CD Concepts** | Learning version control workflows and the theory behind automated pipelines. |
| **03** | **Jenkins Setup** | Setting up Jenkins with Docker-out-of-Docker (DooD) architecture. |
| **04** | **Jenkins Architecture** | Exploring Jenkins home structure, workspaces, and distributed agent concepts. |
| **05** | **Docker Push Pipeline** | Building a manual pipeline to build, tag, and push images to production. |
| **06** | **Pipeline as Code** | Moving to `Jenkinsfile` for version-controlled, automated Declarative Pipelines. |
| **07** | **Multibranch Pipeline** | Automating multiple branches (main, develop, feature-login) with dynamic environments. |
| **08** | **Webhooks Automation** | Achieving true CI/CD with GitHub Webhooks, Ngrok, and native Health Checks. |
